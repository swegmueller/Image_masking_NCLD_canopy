# Image_masking_USFS_tree_canopy_cover
Will mask Planet Dove, Sentinel-2, Landsat or HLS data using USFS Tree Canopy Cover data.
(https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3ATree%20Canopy)

The jupyter notebook is set up to run the masking using a single function. Inputs are minimal.  
I've also included instructions on how to get the Tree Canopy Cover data.

Reprojection and resampling are done automatically.
