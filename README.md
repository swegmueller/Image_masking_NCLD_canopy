# Image_masking_NCLD_canopy
Will mask Planet Dove, Sentinel-2, Landsat or HLS data using USGS Tree Cover data.

The jupyter notebook is set up to run the masking using a single function. Inputs are minimal.  
I've also included directions on how to get the Tree Cover data.

Reprojection and resampling are done automatically.
